## Academic Work

Below is a list and brief description of non-consulting projects I have done for school projects or fun.

### Social Identity and Health in Sub-Saharan Africa
This paper investigates the link between social identity status and health. Social identity is group affiliation, and social identity theory (SIT) hypothesizes that individuals will seek to associate with the highest status groups that they can. If the highest status group individuals can obtain is still of a low status this could generate stress which shows up as decreases physical and mental health.

My paper looks at the correlation between social identity status and self reports of both physical and mental health in a sample of people from Sub-Saharan Africa. One project uses structural equation modeling to test the directionality argument (that social identity status causes poor health and not the other way around). Another project uses hierarchical models to eliminate the differences caused by regional and country variation.

### Dynamics of Socio-Spatial Polarization with Regards to World and National City Centrality
This is my dissertation and uses non-linear dynamical models (cusp catastrophe) to see how the proportion of the middle class in cities has changed as cities become more important to the global economy. World City Theory hypothesizes that more important (or central) a city becomes to the global economy the middle class will be squeezed out by highly paid workers and the very poor people working low wage service jobs.

### IRS Migration AnalysisUtilized IRS migration data to determine the factors correlated with county to county migration utilizing a poisson model. Social Identity and Health in Sub-Saharan AfricaInvestigated the link between social status and stress among a Sub-Saharan African population using hierarchical logistic models and structural equation models.### WFRC Model Sensitivity AnalysisCreated dramatically different spatial arrangements of population and employment for sensitivity analysis of the regional travel demand model.
### Demographic Determinants of TerrorismUtilized a fixed effects negative binomial regression looking at the correlation between demographic trends such as youth unemployment on different types of terrorism.### Effect on Mortality Rates of Populations Born During National Economic DownturnExplored the risk of mortality for those born in periods of economic contraction using the Cox proportional hazard model on the Utah Population Database.

### Patterns of Municipal Water Use
