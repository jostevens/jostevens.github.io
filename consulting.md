## Travel Demand Modeling

I have spent the last several years building, modifying, applying and extracting information from travel demand models. I have primarily used Cube Voyager software and worked with the Utah Statewide Travel-demand Model. A list of specific projects is below.

### Utah Statewide Travel-demand Model (USTM)
With Wilbur Smith Associates (now CDM Smith) I was on the team to develop a statewide model that integrated MPO models. I came late into the project and focused mostly on testing and the creation of automated reports. I implemented the creating of automatic ArcGIS mapping, and scenario comparisons.

### West Henderson Small Area Plan
I applied the Las Vegas TransCAD model to test a variety of scenarios with changing network configurations.

## Data Visualization

I have dabbled in visualizing spatial and non-spatial data. I'm particularly interested in interactive visualizations which allow users to explore the data.

### Demographic File Exploration
This project was designed to check the assumptions of the placement of households and jobs used in the Utah Statewide Travel-demand model. Built with a combination of ArcGIS and Google Earth it allows users to view change over time.

### USTM Reports

### MPO Alternative Analysis

## Economic Impact Modeling

### Effect of Congestion on Job Growth
Applied Machine Learning techniques to determine how the density of jobs in some industries predicted the number of jobs in other industries.
### Ohio Bridge Study
Used census data products to create employment and demographic profiles for the region
