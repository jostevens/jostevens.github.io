My name is John and I like spending my time playing with data and analyzing my kids.

I'm currently finishing up a PhD in Sociology at the University of Utah. My [dissertation](https://github.com/jostevens/Dissertation) looks at the dynamics of socio-spatial polarization in urban areas based on their position in the global urban hierarchy. If that all sounds like gibbserish then congratulations, you're sane. 

I also work as a transportation planner / analyst with [metro analytics](http://metroanalytics.com). I got a masters degree in city and regional planning from the University of Utah in 2009. Most of my work revolves around running travel demand models and  predicting where the road system is going to fail in 30 years. I also occasionally work running an economic impact model.

I have no formal education in math or computer science but seem to be doing more and more of it. I'm a little insecure on that front but the languages of math and code seem to give the greatest opportunity for learning about everything - and that is my ultimate goal.
