I read a blog a while ago that was discussing personal development. In the article there was a suggestion to think about personal development in terms of an RPG skill tree. In RPGs your character has a number of attributes which increase as you go through the game. You are often able to decide which skills you want to enhance and can focus on some at the expense of others.

In this vein I was thinking about the skills I want to develop over the next several months. There are two big categories I want to work on: Communication and Analysis. Each of these has sub-components (and sub-sub-components) which will allow me to focus my time toward measurable goals.

* Communication
	* Visual
		* Interactive Graphics
		* Static Graphics
	* Writing
		* Technical Writing
		* Accessible Writing
* Analysis
	* Network Analysis
	* Big Data (Hadoop/Pig/Hive)
	* Spatial Analysis (spatio-temporal clusters) 
	* Dynamical Systems
	* Grounding in the Math

Most of these skills I already have some familiarity/background in, so hopefully I can create reasonable goals and time frames to measure my progress. In the analysis section I already have some decent goals and timelines because these skills are required for my dissertation. 

I think many of the skills also complement each other, meaning that I can work on multiple skills at the same time. For example I just tried to get a database with 75M records.^[1] This, I'm pretty sure, falls into "Big Data" territory, but I need it to create a network for network analysis. I will also be using the network to look at patterns through time (dynamical systems) and have to write the whole thing up in a way that is accurate and accessible, because my dissertation committee has no idea how to do anything close to what I am proposing. 

From all of these skills the interactive graphics seems to be the most superfluous to my dissertation. That being said, I think it is one of the most important tools to be able to commentate complicated analyses, and engage people with data. The same could be said of accessible writing, which is given lip service in academia, but not often realized. 

To accomplish this stuff I have a couple of books and a lot of online lectures and material to go through. I'm trying to make up a summer schedule that will force me to stay on top of this and get my dissertation done. With any luck I should have a good grasp of all of these skills and a finished dissertation in about six months.
