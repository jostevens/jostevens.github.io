So, new blog. I'm not sure how often I'll be updating this, but I'll try to post some tutorials shortly.

There are a couple of sections to this site. Most will be pretty static, but I'll describe and link to them here.

First there is the working papers section. This will be semi-blog like, but a lot longer. This spot is for academic research papers I'm in the process of writing. Most of my work is quantitative in nature and I use R. The posts here will probably be R markdown files with a lot of theory and a fair bit of code. Once they are finished I'll also post where they got published and possibly where they were rejected. The files are all available on [github]: https://github.com/jostevens.

The next section (consulting) will be kind of a resume. I'll list different projects that I have worked on as a consultant. This will also show some of the graphics that I have been able to make. This will mostly be a resume/marketing page.

The courses section will have syllabi for courses I have taught and others that I am developing. My teaching statement will also be available here.

This blog will be for tutorials and anything else that captures my fancy. It probably won't have a lot of personal stuff, but it may sneak in here and there.
