## Doing Sociology <sub>(SOC 1020)</sub>

I understood this course to be an introduction to quantitative analysis, so I created a series of lectures explaining the joys of data analysis. We started with descriptive statistics in excel and moved up to regression in R.

This course was a requirement for sociology majors and is only offered online. I had about 40 students when I taught in the summer.

The final project was a simple regression analysis with data the students found and that they found interesting. I also provided data from the World Bank Development Indicators for any students who couldn't find anything.

This was an online only course so all of the lectures were presented as downloadable videos. I provided template r scripts which students were encouraged to modify and use. We used R Studio and Markdown for assignment submittals. 

## Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class <sub>(SOC 3360)</sub>

This course was a requirement for the diversity certificate and I had the privilege of teaching it in class and online.

In this course we focused on different theories explaining and critiquing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender and class. The final project was a 10 page research paper focusing on one specific aspect of inequality.

I have taught this class a couple of different ways. The first way I taught we focused on specific racial categories. We then expanded the discussion to see how gender and class intersected within the boundaries of race.

I changed it later to not focus on individual races as much, but look at micro, mezzo, and macro processes that generated inequality. Both ways of teaching had benefits and drawbacks.

One constant was my use of the _Devil's Advocate_ assignment. To engage the students and foster critical thinking all students had to answer a weekly prompt online. A few students would be selected to play devil's advocate and argue against whatever their peers said. My hope was that this would force them to take positions in opposition to their own views and clarify their own thoughts and arguments.
